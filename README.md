# Prediction-of-CO-and-NOX Emmision-WebApp
**OBJECTIVE**: Prediction of Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission

**Description:** Predict the Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission using 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average orsum) from a gas turbine located in Turkey's north western region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions,namely CO and NOx (NO + NO2)

**Motivation:** Harmful effect of Flue gas emitted from power plant turbines on environment has always been a substantial concern. In the recent past years many peaceful protest to save environment has been seen. Environmental organization that seeks to protect, analyse or monitor the environment have conducted many events and activities to raise people awareness on environment. This project aims to predict emission of flue gases based on sensor data from gas turbine and various Machine Learning techniques.

The ML model can be used to predict/estimate amount of emission for future operations of Turbine and Turbine of same homologus series. Model output can also be used for validation and backing up of costly continuous emission monitoring systems used in gas-turbine-based power plants. Their implementation relies on the availability of appropriate and ecologically valid data.

**Data Description:** The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine located in Turkey's north western region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions, namely CO and NOx (NO + NO2).
